# Test Page

Hello there _friend_!

We can use all sorts of markdown **styles** to make things happen.

Here's a link to [my website](https://michaelnthiessen.com).

## What is happening?

This is a new section.

Check out this code:

```html
<template>
  <div class="prose">{{ prop }}</div>
</template>

<script setup>
  defineProps({
    prop: String,
  });
</script>
```

Some more code, this time it's TypeScript:

```ts [types.ts]
type Wallet = {
  money: Number;
  idCard: UserIdCard;
  giftCards: GiftCard[];
};
```

You can see there's a `GiftCard` type but we haven't added that yet.

### Nothing much

Here we have yet another section.
